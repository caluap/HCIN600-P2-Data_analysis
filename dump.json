You'd better get used to environmental destruction, because you don't have the balls to do anything about all those extra people.\n\nIt's pointless to worry about global pollution (atmospheric and oceanic) when the whole rest of the world is out there polluting.

This does not express the full range of attitudes towards approaching climate change, and does not even live up to current strategic practices in some countries! There appears to be some bias in that more options relate to individual choices (going vegan, consuming less), than social reform (carbon tax, infrastructure development, industrial policy). This is fundamentally the wrong way to think about climate change & is particularly obsolete in the current day. The pattern of thought enforced in this survey reminds me very much of attitudes to climate change in the 1980s and 1990s.",
